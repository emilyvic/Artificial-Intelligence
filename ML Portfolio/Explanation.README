This is my portfolio for the Machine Learning Module of my Advanced Artificial Inteligence for Data Science course!

TASK DESCRIPTION:

In this deliverable I implemented a Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm without the use of a Machine Learning and/or estadistical framework/library to determine the alcohol quantity 
in a wine sample. For the development of the testing part, I generated 3 models based on linear regression, each one with a different degree equation. Being 1-degree, 2-dregree 
and 4-degree algorithms respectively. In the preparation part, I made sure to separate the dataset in two groups as training and validation in order to test the precision of the 
algorithm with real results. Then, I tested the implementation of the model with the validation portion of my dataset and printed out some predictions as a sample.
